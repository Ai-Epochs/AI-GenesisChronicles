With the advent of ChatGPT, the era of AI can be said to have truly begun its unfolding. It's time to document the developmental journey of the AI era.

OpenAI released ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, and it gained significant popularity in the following year, 2023. Therefore, I define 2023 as the inaugural year of the AI era.

Based on the definition of the inaugural year of AI, we will organize and document the development journey of AI. Everyone is welcome to make modifications and additions.

And the AI.md file is the English version of the document. Documents in other languages can be identified by their file extensions.
