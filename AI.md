# AI-GenesisChronicles

With the advent of ChatGPT, the era of AI can be said to have truly begun its unfolding. It's time to document the developmental journey of the AI era.

OpenAI released ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, and it gained significant popularity in the following year, 2023. Therefore, I define 2023 as the inaugural year of the AI era.

Based on the definition of the inaugural year of AI, we will organize and document the development journey of AI. Everyone is welcome to make modifications and additions.

## AI Prelude

- OpenAI launched ChatGPT, a large language model-based chatbot, on November 30, 2022. It was built on the GPT-3.5 family of models and employed both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. Initially released as a prototype and a "research preview," ChatGPT allows users to refine and direct conversations in terms of length, format, style, level of detail, and language. This release quickly gained popularity and went viral on social media, showcasing the potential and capabilities of generative AI in conversationâ€‹

## AI era

- Since the inaugural year of AI, OpenAI has continuously improved and upgraded ChatGPT. They released the GPT-4 multimodal large language model capable of processing both text and images, introduced ChatGPT Plus to enhance user experience, and launched the ChatGPT API to enable developers to integrate its functionality into various applications. Additionally, OpenAI faced regulatory challenges globally, such as privacy concerns in Italy, and actively participated in discussions about AI regulation, showcasing the impact and significance of AI technology in society. These actions reflect OpenAI's commitment and efforts in advancing the field of AI.

- In the inaugural year of AI, the field welcomed a variety of generative AI products similar to ChatGPT, significantly expanding the technology's applications. Samsung Gauss, comprising a language model, code assistant, and image editor, demonstrates AI's multifaceted applications. Additionally, Google's Bard AI and Microsoft's Bing Chat, combining search engine and chatbot functions, offer human-like interactions. Products like Claude 2, ChatSonic, and YouChat are recognized for their unique interfaces and responsive capabilities. OpenAI Playground and Perplexity AI provide customization and experimental features, while Character AI and Jasper Chat focus on entertainment and content generation. Other platforms, including Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, GPT-4, NeevaAI, QuillBot, Wix ADI, Otter.ai, Browse.ai, and Elicit, further enrich the scope of generative AI, reflecting the technology's diversity and its widespread impact across various domains.
